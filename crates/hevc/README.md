# filmcraft-hevc

Clean-room, pure-Rust (no `unsafe`) H.265 / HEVC decoder, implemented from the public ITU-T
Rec. H.265 (ISO/IEC 23008-2) specification. It is an L0 crate: it depends only on
`filmcraft-bitstream`, `thiserror`, and optionally `rayon` (default feature `threads`), and builds
for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

All syntax tables (the CABAC `initValue` tables arranged per `initType` following Table 9-4, default
scaling lists, `intraPredAngle` / `invAngle`, the chroma QP table, the deblocking beta'/tC' table,
the luma / chroma interpolation filter taps and the 32x32 DCT matrix) were extracted from the
specification text by [`tools/extract_tables.py`](tools/extract_tables.py) (it only reads the text
of the ITU-T PDF, see the script header); the output is `src/spec_tables.rs`. Scan orders are
derived by the algorithms of 6.5.3-6.5.5. No code was taken or ported from FFmpeg, libde265, x265 or
the HM reference software; ffmpeg / libx265 / VideoToolbox are only used as external test oracles
and fixture generators.

## API

```rust
use filmcraft_hevc::{Decoder, Plane};

let mut dec = Decoder::new(); // or Decoder::with_threads(n), Decoder::from_hvcc(&hvcc)?
for (pts, access_unit) in access_units {
    for pic in dec.decode(access_unit, pts)? {
        // pic.width / pic.height (cropped), pic.bit_depth,
        // pic.y / pic.u / pic.v: Plane::U8(Vec<u8>) for 8-bit, Plane::U16(Vec<u16>) above,
        // pic.y_stride / pic.uv_stride, pic.pts, pic.poc, pic.key (IRAP), pic.color (VUI), pic.sar
    }
}
for pic in dec.flush() { /* ... */ }
if let Some(err) = dec.take_error() { /* error reported by a decoding thread */ }
// dec.set_draft(true): draft mode (playback at reduced resolution only)
```

`decode` expects whole access units (a buffer with several complete access units — e.g. an entire
Annex-B file — also works). RASL pictures following a CRA that starts the stream are skipped, as
ffmpeg does. `Decoder::stats()` returns counters of what was decoded (slice types, IDR/CRA, tiles,
WPP, weighted prediction, TMVP, SAO, block kinds...).

### Architecture

Same design as `filmcraft-h264`: the calling thread parses parameter sets and slice headers and does
POC / RPS / DPB bookkeeping; the CTU layer of each picture runs as a job (rayon pool). A job
reconstructs into private planes, deblocks CTB row r once row r+1 is decoded, applies SAO to row r
once row r+1 is deblocked, and publishes final rows (samples + 16x16 compressed motion for TMVP)
into the shared `Frame` (`OnceLock` per CTB row). Motion compensation of later pictures blocks per
row on exactly the reference rows it reads. Samples are stored as `u16` internally for all bit
depths.

Draft mode (`Decoder::set_draft(true)`; FilmCraft enables it with Settings ▸ Playback ▸ Draft
decoding while the Program monitor plays at 1/2 or 1/4): sub-layer non-reference pictures
(TRAIL_N, RASL_N, ...) of the highest temporal sub-layer — no later picture predicts from them,
and TMVP reads only reference pictures — skip deblocking and SAO and are flagged
`Picture::draft`; every other picture is unchanged. libx265's non-reference B pictures are such
pictures.

Modules: `params` (VPS/SPS/PPS/tile layout), `slice` (NAL + slice header), `dpb` (POC, RPS, lists,
bumping), `cabac`, `slicedec` (CTU syntax + reconstruction), `mvpred` (merge / AMVP / TMVP),
`intra`, `inter`, `transform`, `filter` (deblocking, SAO, row publication), `accel` (hardware
front-end).

### Hardware front-end (`accel`)

Stateless hardware decoding APIs (Vulkan Video, VA-API, D3D11 video) reconstruct pixels from what
the application derives from the bitstream. `accel::Frontend` is this decoder without its CTU
layer: the same NAL handling, parameter sets, slice-header parsing, POC derivation, reference
picture sets, RASL handling and DPB output (bumping) process, reported as events instead of
pictures:

```rust
use filmcraft_hevc::accel::{Event, Frontend};

let mut fe = Frontend::from_hvcc(&hvcc)?; // or Frontend::new() for Annex B
for (pts, access_unit) in access_units {
    for e in fe.decode(access_unit, pts)? {
        match e {
            // p.id, p.vps / p.sps / p.pps, p.poc, p.irap, p.idr, p.st_rps_sps, p.st_rps_bits
            // (slice-header RPS size), p.st_rps_ref_delta_pocs, p.slices (slice segment NAL units),
            // p.st_curr_before / p.st_curr_after / p.lt_curr (RPS lists as ids, bitstream order),
            // p.refs (every picture the RPS keeps: id, POC, long-term), p.dpb (ids held)
            Event::Decode(p) => {}
            // o.id, o.pts, o.poc, o.key, o.crop, o.color, o.sar, o.bit_depth
            Event::Output(o) => {}
        }
    }
}
```

A picture keeps its storage while a later `Decode` lists it in `dpb`, or until it is output;
outputs arrive in the same calls, in the same order, as a single-threaded `Decoder` returns
pictures. Missing references (generated by 8.3.3 in software) are listed with `non_existing`; a
hardware decoder declines those pictures. `filmcraft-platform` builds its Vulkan Video decoder on
it ([ADR 0002](../../docs/adr/0002-linux-vulkan-video.md)). Front-end mode does not allocate
picture planes.

## Tests

`cargo test -p filmcraft-hevc` (fixtures are generated on first use into `target/fixtures/hevc/`
with ffmpeg; tests print a message and skip when ffmpeg is absent).

- Unit tests: CABAC engine round trip against an encoder model and context initialisation, scan
  orders, DCT matrix properties, QpC, intra predictors, transform DC / bounded-region shortcuts,
  MV scaling.
- Synthetic streams (`src/synth_tests.rs`): a small CABAC encoder writes streams with what libx265
  never produces — tiles (uniform and explicit spacing, loop filter across tiles on / off), PCM
  (with and without in-loop filtering), multiple slices, dependent slice segments (starting inside
  and at the start of a tile), long-term reference pictures, reference list modification. Expected
  output is known exactly where filters leave PCM samples alone; every stream is also compared with
  ffmpeg.
- Robustness: hvcC input with pts round trip; randomly corrupted, truncated and garbage input never
  panics or deadlocks (single- and multi-threaded).
- Hardware front-end (`tests/accel.rs`): on every libx265 fixture the front-end outputs, per call,
  exactly what a single-threaded decoder returns (pts, POC, key flag, crop, colour, aspect, bit
  depth); every picture is decoded before it is output and output once; RPS lists and DPB lists
  name only decoded pictures still held; a simulated hardware decoder with
  `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering + 1` slots never runs out of slots or overwrites a picture still
  needed; damaged input gives errors, never a panic. `filmcraft-platform` checks the Vulkan Video
  structures built from the events against ffmpeg's header trace.
- Conformance (`tests/conformance.rs`): every fixture is decoded with 1 thread, 3 threads and every
  core and compared sample-exactly with `ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p / yuv420p10le`; on mismatch
  the first differing frame, plane, sample, CTB and 8x8 block are reported. Output pts/POC order is
  checked too, and that no picture is flagged draft without draft mode. `compare_detects_mismatch`
  guards the harness itself. Draft mode (`draft_mode_changes_only_flagged_non_reference_pictures`):
  on B-pyramid / weighted fixtures, single- and frame-threaded, every unflagged picture is
  bit-exact and only flagged pictures differ.

`cargo test -p filmcraft-hevc --test conformance coverage_report -- --ignored --nocapture` prints the
decoder statistics per fixture.

## Performance

`cargo test --release -p filmcraft-hevc --test perf -- --ignored --nocapture` (bit-exactness is
verified first). Apple M4 Pro (14 cores), measured while the machine was heavily shared (load
average 50-100), so these are lower bounds:

| stream | 1 thread | 14 threads |
|---|---|---|
| 1080p Main, x265 medium CRF 24, 60 frames | ~75 fps | ~225 fps |
| 2160p Main 10, x265 fast CRF 26, 20 frames | ~20 fps | ~95 fps |

No intrinsics: the hot loops are written to auto-vectorise. M4.8
profiling (`cargo xtask bench`, macOS `sample`) found the inverse transform at over half of the
decoder's CPU time: it evaluated the full matrix product with strided table reads. It now sums
contiguous basis rows scaled by the non-zero coefficients only, with the block size a compile-time
constant so the loops vectorise (exact integer sums, so bit-exact; `transform::tests` checks it
against the direct product on random sparse and dense blocks). SAO edge offset has a check-free
loop for samples whose neighbours are inside the CTB. Together: ~60 % less CPU per frame
(1080p 78 → 33 ms, 2160p 320 → 129 ms of CPU per frame through the media stack, alternating A/B), see
[docs/performance.md](../../docs/performance.md).
`cargo run --release -p filmcraft-hevc --example hevcdec -- in.hevc out.yuv` decodes a file
(`HEVC_THREADS=n`, `HEVC_LOOPS=k`, `HEVC_DRAFT=1`).

M4.10 (2026-10-03), CPU cycles per frame counted by the kernel (`/usr/bin/time -l`, all threads
summed; mean of two interleaved base / after rounds at load average 190-320) on the
`cargo xtask bench` decode clips (x265 preset fast, CRF 22, testsrc2 + grain), bit-exact:

| stream | threads | Mcycles / frame before | after | after, draft mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1080p (120 frames) | 1 | 90.9 | **67.3** (−26 %) | 61.2 |
| 1080p | 14 | 100.2 | **75.1** (−25 %) | 67.3 |
| 2160p (72 frames) | 1 | 362.6 | **262.3** (−28 %) | 232.5 |
| 2160p | 14 | 398.3 | **284.8** (−28 %) | 260.1 |

What changed: motion compensation zeroed two 10 KB windows per prediction block per component
and list (11 % of the time in `memset`) and filtered with dynamic-width scalar sums; it now keeps
reusable scratch windows and runs taps outer / outputs inner over fixed block widths. SAO
looked its offset up per sample in a table (20 % of the time); the edge / band offset is now
selected per lane from the neighbour-sign sum / band index, so the runs vectorise. Uni / bi
output clips with min / max instead of `clamp` (whose bound assert kept it scalar). Runs of
bypass bins (signs, Rice suffixes, SAO / intra fields) decode with one division, and
context-coded bins are branch-free. Single-threaded 4K now splits into CABAC residual parsing
~28 %, reference window copies ~11 %, interpolation ~11 %, deblocking + SAO + row publication
~15 %, inverse transform ~8 %.

## Known gaps

- 4:2:2 (Main 4:2:2 10, RExt) is the next step: chroma geometry is 4:2:0-specific in `slicedec`
  (chroma TU placement, second chroma cbf flags, Table 8-3 intra mode mapping), `inter` (vertical
  chroma MV scaling), `filter` (chroma edge spacing, QpC = Min(qPi, 51)) and `picture`. Range
  extension tools (implicit / explicit RDPCM, cross-component prediction, extended precision,
  persistent Rice adaptation, bypass alignment, chroma QP offset lists) are rejected with
  `Error::Unsupported`.
- Tiles and WPP substreams are decoded sequentially (entry points are parsed but the decoder finds
  substream starts itself); parallelism is at the picture level.
- Error concealment is minimal: missing references are replaced by grey pictures, undecodable
  slices leave grey / partial content.
- No fixture covers the `pic_output_flag = 0` path or decoding-order-only CRA handling after EOS
  beyond the synthetic streams; libx265 never emits PCM, tiles or long-term references (covered by
  the synthetic streams only).
