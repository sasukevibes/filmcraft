# filmcraft-h264

Clean-room, pure-Rust (no `unsafe`) H.264 / AVC decoder, implemented from the public ITU-T
Rec. H.264 (ISO/IEC 14496-10) specification. It is an L0 crate: it depends only on
`filmcraft-bitstream`, `thiserror`, and optionally `rayon` (default feature `threads`), and builds
for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

All syntax tables (CAVLC code tables, the 1024 CABAC `(m, n)` context initialisation pairs,
`rangeTabLPS`, scaling defaults, deblocking thresholds, the 8x8 significance-map tables) were
extracted from the specification text (the extraction scripts only read the ITU-T PDF). No code was
taken or ported from FFmpeg, x264, JM or openh264. ffmpeg/libx264 are only used as external test
oracles and fixture generators.

## Supported

- NAL units: Annex-B byte streams and length-prefixed (`avcC`) samples; SPS (all fields incl.
  VUI/HRD, scaling lists with fall-back rules A/B, cropping, high-profile fields), PPS (incl.
  `transform_8x8_mode`, scaling lists, slice groups parsed), SEI / AUD / filler skipped.
- Slice header: all fields incl. reference list modification, prediction weight table and
  decoded reference picture marking. POC types 0, 1, 2. `frame_num` gap handling ("non-existing"
  frames).
- Entropy coding: CAVLC and CABAC (all syntax elements needed for frame coding, 4:2:0).
- Macroblocks: I (Intra 4x4 / 8x8 / 16x16, I_PCM), P (all partitions, P_8x8ref0, P_Skip),
  B (all partitions and sub-partitions, B_Skip, B_Direct_16x16, B_Direct_8x8), spatial and temporal
  direct prediction with/without `direct_8x8_inference`, constrained intra prediction.
- Transforms / quantisation: 4x4, 8x8, Intra16x16 DC Hadamard, 2x2 chroma DC; flat and custom
  scaling matrices (SPS and PPS level).
- Inter prediction: quarter-sample 6-tap luma, eighth-sample chroma, explicit and implicit weighted
  prediction, multiple reference frames, long-term references.
- DPB: sliding window, all MMCOs (1-6), IDR / `no_output_of_prior_pics`, bumping with DPB size from
  the level (or VUI `max_dec_frame_buffering`) and `max_num_reorder_frames`.
- Deblocking filter: full bS derivation, `disable_deblocking_filter_idc` 0/1/2, slice offsets,
  8x8-transform edges.
- Output: cropped 8-bit planar 4:2:0 pictures in output order with the caller's `pts`, POC, key
  flag, VUI colour description (range, primaries, transfer, matrix) and sample aspect ratio.
- Frame-level multithreading (see below).
- Draft mode for reduced-resolution playback (off by default): non-reference pictures skip the
  deblocking filter and are flagged `Picture::draft`; every other picture stays bit-exact.

## API

```rust
use filmcraft_h264::Decoder;

let mut dec = Decoder::new(); // or Decoder::with_threads(n), Decoder::from_avcc(&avcc)?
// dec.threads(): worker threads in use; dec.set_draft(true): draft mode (playback only)
for (pts, access_unit) in access_units {
    for pic in dec.decode(access_unit, pts)? {
        // pic.width / pic.height (cropped), pic.y / pic.u / pic.v, pic.y_stride / pic.uv_stride,
        // pic.pts, pic.poc, pic.key, pic.color, pic.sar
    }
}
for pic in dec.flush() { /* ... */ }
if let Some(err) = dec.take_error() { /* error reported by a decoding thread */ }
```

`decode` expects whole access units (a buffer with several complete access units — e.g. an
entire Annex-B file — also works). `Decoder::stats()` returns counters of the coding tools seen
(macroblock types, slice types, MMCOs, long-term marks, frame_num gaps, ...).

### Hardware front-end (`accel`)

Stateless hardware decoding APIs (Vulkan Video, VA-API, D3D11 video) reconstruct pixels from what
the application derives from the bitstream. `accel::Frontend` is this decoder without its
macroblock layer: the same NAL handling, slice-header parsing, POC computation, reference marking
and DPB output process, reported as events instead of pictures:

```rust
use filmcraft_h264::accel::{Event, Frontend};

let mut fe = Frontend::from_avcc(&avcc)?; // or Frontend::new() for Annex B
for (pts, access_unit) in access_units {
    for e in fe.decode(access_unit, pts)? {
        match e {
            // p.id, p.sps / p.pps, p.frame_num, p.idr, p.idr_pic_id, p.reference, p.intra,
            // p.poc (top, bottom), p.stored (as kept for reference), p.slices (NAL units),
            // p.refs (reference pictures: id, FrameNum / LongTermFrameIdx, POCs), p.dpb (ids held)
            Event::Decode(p) => {}
            // o.id, o.pts, o.poc, o.key, o.crop, o.color, o.sar: in the software decoder's order
            Event::Output(o) => {}
        }
    }
}
```

A picture keeps its storage while a later `Decode` lists it in `dpb`, or until it is output;
outputs arrive in the same calls, in the same order, as a single-threaded `Decoder` returns
pictures. `filmcraft-platform` builds its Vulkan Video decoder on it
([ADR 0002](../../docs/adr/0002-linux-vulkan-video.md)). Front-end mode does not allocate picture
planes. Known difference: for a picture with MMCO 5, `poc` is the order count the picture is
decoded with (8.2.1); the software decoder uses 0 for that picture's own inter prediction, which
only matters for B pictures carrying MMCO 5 with temporal direct or implicit weighting (libx264
never writes MMCO 5).

### Threading model

The calling thread parses headers and performs all POC / DPB / reference-list bookkeeping (it only
needs header data). The macroblock layer of each picture is decoded as a job on a rayon pool. A job
reconstructs into private buffers, deblocks each macroblock row once the row below it is
reconstructed, and publishes finished rows (samples + motion data for co-located lookups) into the
picture's shared `Frame` (`OnceLock` per macroblock row). Jobs of later pictures block per row on
exactly the reference rows they read, so many pictures decode concurrently while the output stays
bit-exact. Without the `threads` feature (or on wasm, or with `with_threads(1)`) jobs run inline.
With threads, `decode` returns pictures once their job has finished, so output lags input by up to
roughly the number of threads.

Deblocking is row-parallel in this pipelined form: each picture's job filters macroblock row r as
soon as row r + 1 is reconstructed (intra prediction of row r + 1 reads the unfiltered bottom
line of row r) and publishes it one row later, while the jobs of other pictures run on other
threads. A picture waiting on a reference therefore waits only for that reference's rows its
motion vectors reach plus about two rows, so a chain of reference pictures (a seek from an IDR
picture) advances a few rows behind its predecessor instead of a whole picture behind it. A
separate deblocking thread per picture would shorten that lag by about one row and would need its
own copy of the reconstructed rows and macroblock state; it is not worth it while the pool has
more pictures in flight than cores. The hot loops are written to vectorise without `unsafe` or
intrinsics: the edge filters process all 16 (luma) or 8 (chroma) lines of an edge at once with
per-lane masks, the inverse transforms do their column pass across all columns, and the CABAC
engine decodes a context-coded bin without branching on its outcome.

### Draft mode

`Decoder::set_draft(true)` (reduced-resolution playback only; FilmCraft enables it with Settings ▸
Playback ▸ Draft decoding while the Program monitor plays at 1/2 or 1/4 resolution) skips the
deblocking filter (8.7) of non-reference pictures (`nal_ref_idc` 0). No picture is predicted from
a non-reference picture, and deblocking never changes the motion data that direct prediction
reads, so every other picture is unchanged; the skipped pictures are flagged `Picture::draft` and
the media stack never hands them to a paused monitor, a render or an export. On the 4K fixture
below it saves ~9 % of the decoding work (the B-pyramid's non-reference half of the B pictures).

## Tests

`cargo test -p filmcraft-h264` (fixtures are generated on first use into `target/fixtures/h264/`
with ffmpeg + libx264; tests print a message and skip when `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` is absent).

- Unit tests: CAVLC tables (prefix-freeness / Kraft sums, spec-style residual example), CABAC engine
  (context init formula, round trip against an encoder model), intra predictors with hand-computed
  values, transforms, luma interpolation against a straightforward reference implementation,
  weighting, macroblock type tables, scaling-list parsing.
- Synthetic streams (`src/synth_tests.rs`): hand-built CAVLC and CABAC bitstreams covering what
  libx264 never produces — I_PCM, long-term references, MMCO 1-6, `frame_num` gaps, reference list
  modification (short- and long-term), explicit weighted prediction in P and B slices, B_Skip with
  explicit bi-prediction. The expected output is known exactly and is also checked against ffmpeg.
- Robustness: avcC input with pts round trip; randomly corrupted, truncated and garbage input never
  panics or deadlocks (single- and multi-threaded).
- Conformance (`tests/conformance.rs`): every fixture is decoded single-threaded, with 3 threads
  and with every core, and compared byte-for-byte with `ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p`; on
  mismatch the first differing frame, plane, sample position and macroblock are reported. Output
  pts/POC order is checked too, and that no picture is flagged draft without draft mode. Draft
  mode (`draft_mode_changes_only_flagged_non_reference_pictures`): on five B-pyramid / B-frame
  fixtures, single- and frame-threaded, every unflagged picture is bit-exact and only flagged
  pictures differ.
- Vectorised kernels against their straightforward forms on random input: the deblocking edge
  filter against the per-line filter, the 4x4 / 8x8 inverse transforms against the per-column
  formulation.
- Hardware front-end (`tests/accel.rs`): on every libx264 fixture the front-end outputs the same
  pictures as the software decoder (order, pts, POC, key flag, crop, colour, aspect); per call it
  outputs exactly what a single-threaded decoder returns; every picture is decoded before it is
  output and output once; references and DPB lists name pictures still held; a simulated
  hardware decoder with `max_dpb_frames + 1` slots never runs out of slots or overwrites a picture
  still needed; slices pass through byte for byte; damaged input gives errors, never a panic.

### Fixture matrix (all bit-exact, single- and multi-threaded)

libx264 fixtures unless noted; the VideoToolbox (hardware encoder) fixtures are skipped where that
encoder is unavailable.

## Performance

`cargo test --release -p filmcraft-h264 --test perf -- --ignored --nocapture` (1080p High profile,
CABAC, B-pyramid, 120 frames, 8.8 Mbit/s; bit-exactness is verified first). Measured on an Apple M4
Pro (14 cores) while the machine was heavily shared (load average 40-180), so these are lower bounds:

| threads | fps |
|---|---|
| 1 | ~105-122 (≈ 33 Mcycles per frame) |
| 14 | ~500-600 |

4K High profile (testsrc2 + grain, 3840x2160, CABAC, B-pyramid, ~170 Mbit/s; the first 48 frames
of the playback benchmark's `a2160.mp4`), CPU cycles per frame counted by the kernel
(`proc_pid_rusage`; independent of machine load, all threads summed; bit-exact with ffmpeg):

| build | Mcycles / frame | instructions / frame |
|---|---|---|
| before M4.9 | 505 | 1232 M |
| M4.9 | **390** (−23 %) | 1195 M |
| M4.9, draft mode | **356** (−30 %) | 1068 M |

The same on the benchmark's 1080p fixture (`dec_h264_1080.mp4`, 120 frames): 132 → 100 Mcycles
per frame (−24 %), 90 in draft mode. Single-threaded 4K time (`sample` profile) splits into CABAC
residual decoding 41 %, deblocking 16 % (25-30 % before), other macroblock-layer parsing 11 %,
inverse transforms and dequantisation 9 %, motion compensation 8 %, intra prediction 6 %, row and
picture copies 4 %. At ~4.5 GHz a 4K frame takes ~85 ms of one
core, so 23.976 fps needs about two cores' worth of frame threads.

The example `cargo run --release -p filmcraft-h264 --example h264dec -- in.h264 out.yuv` decodes a
file; `H264_BENCH_ITERS=n` (and `H264_THREADS=t`, `H264_DRAFT=1`) turns it into a benchmark,
`H264_STATS=1` prints the coverage counters.

## Known gaps

- Interlaced coding (field pictures, PAFF, MBAFF): streams with `frame_mbs_only_flag = 0` return
  `Error::Unsupported`.
- Only 8-bit 4:2:0. High 10 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 / monochrome and lossless
  (`qpprime_y_zero_transform_bypass`) return `Error::Unsupported`.
- FMO (slice groups), SP/SI slices, data partitioning (Extended profile), MVC/SVC NAL units.
- Error concealment is minimal: undecodable slices leave the prediction/previous content; missing
  references are replaced by other references.
- No SIMD intrinsics (the hot loops are written to auto-vectorise); CABAC residual decoding is
  inherently serial and now dominates.

### Extending to High 10 and 4:2:2

The chroma format and bit depth are isolated behind `Sps::check_supported`. The parts that are
format-specific today: `Planes`/`FrameRow` sample type (`u8`; a `u16` variant or a generic sample
type is needed for bit depths > 8, together with `Clip1` ranges, `QpBdOffset` in the QP
derivations and the scaled tC0/alpha/beta in deblocking), chroma block geometry (`MbWidthC` /
`MbHeightC` = 8x8 in `slicedec`, `intra::pred_chroma`, the chroma DC transform and the CABAC/CAVLC
chroma DC parsing — the 2x4 total_zeros tables and ctxBlockCat 3 `NumC8x8` handling are already in
place), chroma motion-vector vertical scaling and the chroma deblocking edges (4:2:2 has four
horizontal chroma edges).
